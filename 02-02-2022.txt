Static block is a block which contains set of statement those are executed before 
the main method.

}
Initialized Block:- Initialized block is a block of statement which is 
executed whenever we create an instance for that particular class

{
System.out.println("Initilized ");
}

Student std=new Student()


Type casting:- converting one datatype value to another data type value.

int x=10;
byte b=(byte)x;  ---b is called target
		---x source
1. Widening Type casting (Auto Conversion) Implict
2. Narrowing typecasting (Explicit)

int,float,double,short,byte,long

byte--->short --->int --->long--- >float(6-7)--->double(precision)14-15

double--->float--->long--->int---->short--->byte

byte b=120;
int x=(int)b;

Conditional Statement:- Statment will be executed based on the Condition 

if(condition){


}
condition returns either true or false;

int x=5;
if(x==5){
System.out.println("X value is equal to 5");
}
4 Types of If conditions are available in java
1. If Condition 
2. If else Condition 
3. If-else-if condition 
4. multiple if condition.
