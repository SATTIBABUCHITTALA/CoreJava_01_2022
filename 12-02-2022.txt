OOPS Concepts:- 
Object Oriented Programming

OOPS Concepts:- 
Class:- Class is a blue print which has certian attributes and behaviors
methods and Variables. We create objects to access these methods and variables.

class Car{

String typeOfCar;
String brandOfTheCar;
int typeOfTubes;
double price;
String typeOfFule;
double milage;

void startTheEngine(){


}

void stopTheEngine(){

}
void accelerate();

}
double getSpeed(){

}


}

Maruti --- is also called a class -----object.


//Maruti is also another class which follows some behaviors from Car Class.
//Maruti will desing a Car which follows these behaviors

HUMAN is a class Male is also a class Satti Babu is an object.

Female is also a class Bindu,Srujana They are object


FOR ALL THE CLASSES 
OBJCET IS A SUPER CLASS

java.lang.Object

Object:- Object is an instance of a class. It is a real time entity. It is used to acces
the properties of a class. 

Inheritance:- Aquiring properties from one class to another class is called inheritance.
Why do we need inheritance?
Because to avoid the redundancy.
class Human{


}
class Male{

}
class Car{
}

Car car=new Car();

class Maruti extends Car{


}
How many types of Inheritance:- 
1. Single Inheritance
	class A{
		void getValue(){
		}
	}
class B {
	void getValue(){
		}
}

class C extends A,B{

}

B b=new B();
C c=new C();
c.getValue();

b.getValue();
Note:- A class can aquire properties from only one class
class B extends A
class B extends A,C;




2. Hybrid Inheritance
3. Multi level Inheritance
4. Multiple Inheritance

Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Abstraction
