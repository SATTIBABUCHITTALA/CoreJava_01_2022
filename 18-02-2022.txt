Constructor Overloading:- Multiple constructors with different parameters. 
is called Constructor overloading.

Private Constructor:- A constructor which is created by using private 
access modifier is called private constructor.
It is used to restrict the creation of object of that class outside.


Advantage of Private constructor:- To avoid creating object for that class

class A{

private A(){}

}
A a=new A(); //new object
A a1=new A(); //new object 
A a2=new A(); //new object 
When do you use Private Constructor?

What is a singleton Class ? 
A class which can be provided only one instance through out the application/jvm
 is called singleton class.
Ex:- Database Connection, User Name, Passwords

How can we make a class as a singleton ?

public class Student{

private Student(){}

public static Student studentObject=null; //class level variable it holds the object of the particular class
 

public Synchronized static Student getObject(){

if(studentObject ==null){
return new Student();

}else{
return studentObject;
}

}
What is constructor chaining?
Calling one constructor from another constructor is called Constructor Chaining. 
we use this() to call the constructor with in the same class.
this is a keyword which represents the current object. 
Note:- This should be the first statement in a constructor.
If u want to call another constructor from constructor that should be the first statement/

class A{

public A(){
this(10);
}
public A(int a){

}

}



Access Modifiers:- 












}


DataConnection connection =new DataConnection();

100 connections 
performance will get impact.
