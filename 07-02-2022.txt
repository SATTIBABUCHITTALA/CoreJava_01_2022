For Each Loop:- 

Type of for loop. Uses when we deal with list of Elements.

for loop fails why because the condition and exit point is not in my control.

while Loop:- It checks the condtion and executes untill the condtion fails . 

while(condtion){

System.out.println("kajf");


}
do-while loop is also there:- it executes the block of statement 
atleast once and verify the condtion.

do {


}while(condition);
