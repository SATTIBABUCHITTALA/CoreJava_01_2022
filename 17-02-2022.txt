//Constructors 


Constructor is Special type of Method which is used to initilize the object.

class A{

public A(){

}
}
A a=new A();
Diff between a method and Constructor:- 
1.We need to call a method Explicitly but JVM will call the Constructor
2. There is no return type for constructor but method should have returntype.
1. Default Constructor
2. Parameterized Constructor
